# Stitch Tracker
I wanted an application that let me easily track stitches and other things related to knitting and crochet.  I specifically wanted this application so that I can potentially track stats for if I want to sell my products

## Features I want:
- Row counter
- Ability to add more counters that the user can name
- Ability to add a timer feature so that the user can see how long a project took if they plan on selling the project, or if they are just curious
- Ability to take notes
- Ability to see stats of finished projects

## Nice to have features:
- Ability to import their pattern so that they can see it in the app along with their other project information

## Tech stack:
- React / Electron
