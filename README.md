# Stitch Tracker

I wanted an application that let me easily track stitches and other things related to knitting and crochet

Create project and name it -> click on project card -> default to row counter
-> add counter -> name the counter and now there are 2 counters under the same project
-> add timer / stop watch to track how long a project takes
-> add project notes
-> set project to done

When viewing done projects the user can see what their named counters, notes, start date, end date, and total time
